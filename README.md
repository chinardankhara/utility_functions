# utility_functions

Hey, I am someone who works a lot with the SciPy and Python numerical computing stack. This is a bunch of functions I am writing to automate common routines in data analysis and exploration in python. I hope this can help you. If you want something added, create a github issue and I will try to add it. Cheers!
